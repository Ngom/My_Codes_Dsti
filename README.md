# Codes and little projects at DSTI 

You can find here some codes I have written in my DSTI training experience. Types of codes are :

- __Python__ (with _Jupyter Notebook_ as code editor)
- __R__
- __SQL__
- __Dockerfile__

It is all about data science and applied maths. 

Thank you for reading me.
